These scripts are provided in light of transparency of the work published in the manuscript and should be useful in the case of wanting to replicate the approach followed to analyse these data. However, we are not able to support running of the provided code on alternative environments.

Numbers preceding the name of each script indicate the ideal order of execution as latter scripts may contain blocks of code that depend on previously generated data. Note that package updates may change the usage of some functions over time as well as specific computing environments may require adaptation of the code for proper reproducibility. 

The names are a general indication of their usage. Comments within the code and a breief description of its purpose, inputs and outputs can be found at the start of each file.
